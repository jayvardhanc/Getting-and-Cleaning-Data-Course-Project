Data Dictionary : Human Activity Recognition.

  *  subjectId : Unique Identifier to identify participating subjects.

  *  Activity : Activity States to be analyzed through accelerometer and gyroscope data.
    * WALKING * WALKING_UPSTAIRS * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS * SITTING * STANDING * LAYING

Variables Used :

  *  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ.
  *  The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ).
  *  The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

  *  Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
